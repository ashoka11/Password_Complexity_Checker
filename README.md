# Password_Complexity_Checker

    Password Strength Checker

Overview:
This Python script assesses the strength of a given password based on various criteria, providing feedback on areas for improvement if the password is deemed weak. The criteria include length, the presence of uppercase and lowercase letters, digits, and special characters.

Usage:
1. Run the script by executing the password_strength_checker.py file.
2. Enter the desired password when prompted.
3. The script will evaluate the password based on length, character types, and the presence of special characters.
4. Receive feedback indicating whether the password is strong or weak, along with suggestions for improvement if applicable.

Functions:

=>> check_password_strength(password):
* Evaluates the strength of the password against specific criteria.
* Checks for length, uppercase and lowercase letters, digits, and special characters.
* Returns a message indicating whether the password is strong or weak, along with specific feedback for improvement.

=>> main():
* Collects user input for the password.
* Calls the check_password_strength function to assess the password strength.
* Prints the result with feedback.

Example:

Enter your password: StrongPwd123!
Strong password!

In this example, the script evaluates the password "StrongPwd123!" as strong since it meets the length requirement and includes uppercase letters, lowercase letters, digits, and special characters.

Enter your password: weakpwd
Weak password. Consider the following improvements:
- Ensure the password is at least 8 characters long.
- Include at least one uppercase letter.
- Include at least one digit.
- Include at least one special character (!@#$%^&*(),.?":{}|<>).

In this example, the script provides feedback on the weaknesses of the password "weakpwd" and suggests improvements to meet the criteria.

Note:
* This implementation is designed to encourage users to create strong and secure passwords.
* Customize the criteria and feedback messages as needed for specific password policies.
